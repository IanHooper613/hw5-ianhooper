Workday Scheduler

We were given the challenge of coming up with a calendar application that any user could use.  The main requirement of the calendar was that, when the user entered information into the calendar, the information remained, even when the page was refreshed.  


Below is a screensot of the application.

Project

I decided to base my html and js files around the CSS file was was given to us.
Building the html file was the easy part; figureing out the JavaScript and the JQuery was more challenging.  Fortunately there is a lot of information on the web to assist when you are stuck.  

This application was built with:

HTML
CSS
JavaScript
JQuery
Moment.js
